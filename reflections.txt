# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  I'm still working on it, But for this first part I spent like 3 hours and half

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  I had some troubles with the errors throws and
  I had to spend a lot of time researching about this topic
  So I guess that's the most rewarding challenge

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  I think changing priority levels and using a gem in an innovate way is a good feature
  to implement and also for learning purpose.
  -->Update:
  I added two features to the app
    1- the generate pdf functionality: for this I used the gems prawn and prawn-table, those
    gems helped me to generate a pdf with a table inside with the Items. This is only for
    the Event and Todo Items, so I used the filter functionality in order to filter out The
    Link Item types.
    2- The logging feature: for this feature I created a loggeable module and inside I required the logger class
    from the Ruby standard library to create the logger instance variable and then I included the module inside the
    UdaciList class for logging purpose.

    Also the pdf file and the log file, when you re run the program those files will be deleted if exists before their creation
    using the FileUtils Module

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  I had to improve in the errors throws, and see how ruby works in its core with this.
  Also I'll try to read some code of the rubygems
  that I'm going to use to learn how to craft good quality code
