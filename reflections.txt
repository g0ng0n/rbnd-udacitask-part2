# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  I'm still working on it, But for this first part I spent like 3 hours and half

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  I had some troubles with the errors throws and
  I had to spend a lot of time researching about this topic
  So I guess that's the most rewarding challenge

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  I think changing priority levels and using a gem in an innovate way is a good feature
  to implement and also for learning purpose.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  I had to improve in the errors throws, and see how ruby works in its core with this.
  Also I'll try to read some code of the rubygems
  that I'm going to use to learn how to craft good quality code
